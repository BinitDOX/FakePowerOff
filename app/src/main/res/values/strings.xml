    <string name="text_about">The Fake Power Off app simulates device shutdown with a minimal animation.
        Perfect for deterring unauthorized access, the app provides a convincing visual effect without actually powering off the device.
        Ideal for use with anti-theft apps and remains effective even when the device is locked.</string>
    <string name="prominent_disclosure_title">Prominent Disclosure: Permission Required</string>
    <string name="prominent_disclosure_body">\nThis app requires the Accessibility Service permission to provide its core functionality. Specifically, this permission allows the app to:\n\n1. Detect when the power menu is opened.\n2. Replace the default power menu with a custom fake power menu.\n3. Simulating a device shutdown by using an overlay.\n4. Detect volume button press sequence to recover from the overlay.\n\nThe Accessibility Service permission is crucial for the app to function correctly and provide the intended user experience. This app does not change any settings without your permission, bypass Android\'s built-in privacy controls, or engage in any deceptive practices.\n\nAdditionally, the app requests the Do Not Disturb (DND) permission to optionally put the device in the DND mode during the fake power off simulation. This permission is optional and can be granted if you wish to use this feature.\n\nBy continuing, you acknowledge the necessity of these permissions for the app\'s functionality. Do you wish to proceed?\n</string>
